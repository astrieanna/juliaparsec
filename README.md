===========

A Parsec clone in Julia

Currently, it's pretty rudimentary.
The basic operations work, but it doesn't
have nice syntax, the way most parser combinator libraries do, and
it's also missing pretty much any advanced feature you can think of.

Most of the current files are various attempts to figure out whether
the basic approach is reasonable, both in speed and conciseness.
